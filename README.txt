Simple Distance Calculator (without frontend)


The project started @ 20/08/2020

It was builded for the sole purpose to measure distance from longitude-latitude perspective (try it yourself)
& also to help me move forward with my weather station project

it was written in exactly 30 minutes 

then I moved on to include openweathermaps to my weather station
